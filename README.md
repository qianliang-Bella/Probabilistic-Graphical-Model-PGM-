# Probabilistic-Graphical-Model-PGM-
Goal of this assignment is to show how with directed acyclic graph we can represent a probability distribution much more compactly. It is based on two key ideas we learned in the lecture: conditional independence and factorization of joint probabilities by the graphical model.
